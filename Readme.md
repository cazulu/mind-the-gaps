This repository contains all the source code involved in the master thesis project "Minding the EM gaps: First steps toward developing a distributed white space sensor for spectrum-sensing cognitive
radio", done at the KTH ICT department. The project is organized in several folders, each containing a part of the programme:

-blinker/: Simple LED-blinking code to test the microcontroller platform and the network bootloader.
-frequencyScanner/: Frequency scanning program for the microcontroller platform.
-scannerGUI/: Python scripts for the user interface and the UDP server backend.
-TFTPboot/: Network bootloader for the microcontroller platform.
